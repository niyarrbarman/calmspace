# Project Title : CalmSpace

CalmSpace is an end to end sentiment analysis platform

# Description

CalmSpace is an end to end sentiment analysis platform where the user can record or upload the recorded files of their emotion and the deep learning model will learn through algorithm like RNN Model Architecture, and will predict the emotion of the voice . The sentiment analysis will be shown through various graph plot in much understandable way.

# Model Architecture

## RNN

Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. In traditional neural networks, all the inputs and outputs are independent of each other, but in cases like when it is required to predict the next word of a sentence, the previous words are required and hence there is a need to remember the previous words. Thus RNN came into existence, which solved this issue with the help of a Hidden Layer. The main and most important feature of RNN is Hidden state, which remembers some information about a sequence.

## LSTM

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems.LSTM can by default retain the information for a long period of time.LSTM recurrent unit is much more complex than that of RNN, which improves learning but requires more computational resources.The basic workflow of a Long Short Term Memory Network is similar to the workflow of a Recurrent Neural Network with the only difference being that the Internal Cell State is also passed forward along with the Hidden State.It is used for processing, predicting, and classifying on the basis of time-series data.LSTM deals with algorithms that try to mimic the human brain the way it operates and to uncover the underlying relationships in the given sequential data.
